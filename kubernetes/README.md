Here's a comprehensive README file that you can place inside the `./kubernetes/` directory. It expands on your notes, providing a detailed guide for deploying the ELK stack using either `kubectl` or Helm.

# Deploying the ELK Stack on Kubernetes

This directory contains resources to deploy the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack on a Kubernetes cluster. You can choose between two deployment options: using plain Kubernetes manifests with `kubectl` or using Helm charts for a more flexible and templated deployment.

## Prerequisites

- A running Kubernetes cluster (e.g., Minikube, kind, GKE, EKS).
- `kubectl` configured to communicate with your Kubernetes cluster.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/) installed for Helm-based deployments.

## Directory Structure

- `option-1-helm/`: Contains the Helm chart for deploying the ELK stack.
- `option-2-kubectl/`: Contains plain Kubernetes manifests for deploying the ELK stack.

## Deploy with kubectl

To deploy the ELK stack using plain Kubernetes manifests, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Apply the Kubernetes Manifests

Apply all the manifests in the `option-2-kubectl/` directory to deploy Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana, and the setup job:

```sh
kubectl apply -f kubernetes/option-2-kubectl/
```

### Step 2: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of the deployed Pods to ensure everything is running correctly:

```sh
kubectl get pods
```

### Step 3: Access Kibana

Forward the Kibana service port to your local machine to access the Kibana UI:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/kibana 5601:5601
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5601`.

### Step 4: Cleanup

To remove the ELK stack from your cluster, delete the resources:

```sh
kubectl delete -f kubernetes/option-2-kubectl/
```

## Deploy with Helm

To deploy the ELK stack using Helm, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Customize Helm Values (Optional)

Before deploying, you can customize the Helm chart by modifying the `values.yaml` file in the `option-1-helm/` directory. This file allows you to set parameters such as the Elasticsearch version, storage size, and passwords.

### Step 2: Install the Helm Chart

Install the ELK stack using the Helm chart:

```sh
helm install elk-stack kubernetes/option-1-helm
```

### Step 3: Override Default Values (Optional)

You can override the default values specified in `values.yaml` by passing your own values during installation:

```sh
helm install elk-stack kubernetes/option-1-helm --set elasticVersion=7.12.0 --set elasticsearch.storage=2Gi
```

### Step 4: Verify the Deployment

Check the status of the Helm release and the Pods:

```sh
helm status elk-stack
kubectl get pods
```

### Step 5: Access Kibana

Forward the Kibana service port to your local machine to access the Kibana UI:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/elk-stack-kibana 5601:5601
```

Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5601`.

### Step 6: Cleanup

To remove the ELK stack deployed via Helm from your cluster, uninstall the Helm release:

```sh
helm uninstall elk-stack
```

## Notes

- **Templating**: Helm templates use placeholders like `{{ .Values.elasticVersion }}` to pull in values from the `values.yaml` file, making the deployment configurable without changing the templates themselves.
- **Custom Values**: Users can override the default values specified in `values.yaml` by passing their own values when installing the Helm chart.
- **Secrets**: Sensitive information such as passwords is referenced through Kubernetes `Secrets`, allowing secure handling of credentials.

## Conclusion

This guide provides you with the steps needed to deploy the ELK stack on a Kubernetes cluster using either `kubectl` or Helm. Choose the method that best suits your needs, and feel free to customize the deployment to fit your environment.

If you have any questions or run into issues, please consult the Kubernetes and Helm documentation or seek help from the community.
